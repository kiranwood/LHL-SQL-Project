# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals

This project is focusing on extracting, transforming, cleaning, loading and analyzing data. As well as developing and running a QA process.

The goals of this project is to:
- Load data into a database
- Clean data
- Answer questions based on the data
- Create a QA process

## Process

### Step 1

Download the CSV files and create a new database. Then create tables for each file and import file. Make sure all of the columns are filled in correctly and writing queries using the table is working.

### Step 2

Check out each of the questions and keep track of which columns are important to answering the questions. Get a general idea of how to solve the questions using queries.

### Step 3

Start making CTE's that can later be turned into View's or Temporary Tables that include the columns needed to answer the questions. Make sure these CTE's are normalized, remove duplicates and make sure there are unique keys.

### Step 4

Using the CTE's make queries to answer each of the questions. Come up with 5 new questions to be able to answer using the data. Then write queries to be able to find the answer for those.

### Step 5

Clean CTE's further. Check each column for potiental data issues and transform data to fix these issues. Format and organize CTE's to be easier to read and understand. Add comments where neccessary. Put the CTE's used in the cleaning_data.md file.

### Step 6

Using the cleaned CTE's, make sure each query for answering the question works and is also formated and organized for readability. Write down the answers to the questions by using the queries. Add the queries/answers of the original 5 questions into the starting_with_quesitions.md file. Then add the answers/queries of new 5 questions into the starting_with_date.md.

## Results
(fill in what you discovered this data could tell you and how you used the data to answer those questions)
